# DESCRIPTION

This project was inspired by my first client in my freelancing journey. Thank you for believing in me. 
The advertisement was used to attract people who wanted to sell their timeshares. This data had 1229 entities and 10 columns.
My project concentrates on getting probability estimation of a lead and ranking leads from highest probability to lowest probability.
The data has been trained on a couple of models such as: LogisticRegression, RandomForest and XGBoost.
